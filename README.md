Learning how to use github.

I'm creating this when I am 20.

I'm an enthusiast when it comes to computer hardware and gaming, I'm currently purusing a Bachelors Degree for Computer Information Systems, and I plan to have a job in an IT field in the future.

I'm also a huge fan of Dungeons & Dragons, I play fairly often.

I love listening to music and I am currently working on my music skills as well in order to release some form of LP or Mixtape in the next few years.

I want to use Github as a bit of a Portfolio to show potential employers, a resource where I can see my past and current works, and a way to connect and share what I have learned or want to learn.
